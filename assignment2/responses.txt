The World wide web is different from the internet in the way that the world wide web contains the pages you see when youre at a device and online while the internet is the network of connected computers that the web works on plus what emails and files travel through.
The internet works by sending data from one place to another. 
A directory is essentially a folder or collection of files.
VCS will benefit you by allowing you to track all changes to documents, files, etc.
